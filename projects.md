Here is a list of projects I am working on:

- [Jarvis](https://github.com/novarac23/jarvis/) (WIP)
  - Jarvis is a voice assistant that can answer simple factual qustions (ie When was Michael Jordan born?)
- [tweetanator](https://github.com/novarac23/tweetanator) (URL: [https://tweetanator.novarac.com](https://tweetanator.novarac.com))
  - Tweetanator searches for tweets on a specific topic and then does sentiment analysis on those tweets.
