Here is a list of projects I'm working on:

- [Jarvis](https://github.com/novarac23/jarvis/) (WIP)
  - Jarvis is a voice assistant that can answer simple factual qustions (ie When was Michael Jordan born?)
- [tweetanator](https://github.com/novarac23/tweetanator)
  - I created tweetanator a while ago when I was learning NLP for the first time. Basically it does "positive/negative" sentiment analysis on tweets.
