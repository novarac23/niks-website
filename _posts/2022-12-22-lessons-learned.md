description: Lessons that I learned this year

It\'s December and that means it\'s time to relax, decompress and reflect on lessons that I learned this year.

## Make progress (on average)
There have been plenty of times this year where I felt like I went backwards instead of forward. I realized that it\'s perfectly fine to not make progress as long as, on average, you move forward. What I mean by this is that you might have bad days / weeks / months but as long you pick yourself up and follow up with good days / weeks / months you\'ll move the needle forward. 

## Health is wealth
After a few random health scares this year I realized for the first time in my life that health is wealth. I knew that before of course, but more on a conceptual level. This year I learned that on a practical level and I\'ve become very grateful for the genetics and generally good health that I have.

I\'ve bought a fitness tracker called [whoop](https://www.whoop.com/) and it\'s been very helpful in understanding how my actions map to my overall well-being. Here\'s a chart of my recovery vs exertion for this week (right side is recovery, blue/left side is exertion):

I\'m feeling pretty good this week and there\'s data to back it up (lots of green dots)!

## It\'s all about insights
For the longest time in my career, I\'ve been excited about tools. Anything from the newest machine learning library in Python to Tableau. Lately, I don\'t get as excited about tools but rather about insights that I can gather from the data. So now when I work on a data science / analytics project I focus a lot more on insights as opposed to pondering which tool is the shiniest. 

That\'s all folks! Happy Holidays!
