One of the most effective ways to learn (for me) is to create a tight feedback loop and to keep iterating through that loop. 

Here\'s a few examples:

- If I have a machine learning model one of the best ways to get model in a decent shape is to iterate/experiment a lot. After every experiment I\'d get feedback on how the model did and I\'d try to improve on that.
- If I\'m making a deck one of the best ways to make that deck good is to have a group of mentors review it periodically and give me constructive feedback
- If I\'m learning a new skill, one of the best ways to learn that skill is to test myself constantly (aka seek feedback) and try to improve based on that.

Here are a few tools that allow me to create a tight feedback loop:

- Jypiter notebook
- Google slides
- Coursera (has built in tests)
