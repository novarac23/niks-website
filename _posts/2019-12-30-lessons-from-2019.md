description: Lessons I Learned In 2019
---

Here\'s a list of things I learned (or relearned in some cases) in 2019:

- When you love what you do it does not feel like work
- Sometimes you have to do things you don\'t want to do to get to do things you want to do
- If you are doing things you don\'t want to be doing for a long period of time reassess your path, approach etc.
- Inaction is sometimes best course of action 
- Frustration comes from unreasonable expectations, not being patient enough or worrying about things Â that are out of your control
- Having a routine increases likelihood for success
- It\'s important to have when times you are not doing anything. Often solutions to really hard problems come when you are making a sandwich or taking a shower
- Spend more time on helping out and solving problems as opposed to judging and complaining
