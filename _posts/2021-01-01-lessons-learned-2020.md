description: Lessons I Learned In 2020
---

2020 was a crazy year. I've learned (and in some cases relearned) a lot. Here are a few of the most important lessons from this year:

* Without clarity in the mind, it's very easy for anxiety, confusion and overthinking to creep in. (journaling & [meditation](https://www.headspace.com) helped me a lot with this)
* We only need to worry about things that are in our control. (highly recommend [Stoicism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism) for practicing this)
* One of the best ways to get better at a thing is just to do the thing (even if its for a bit) every day.
* Good diet, sleep and exercise are staples of a good life. Skip out on any of those and it will eventually catch up with you.
